# check-tree-hygiene.sh — the guards that used to run only at copy-in time.
#
# HISTORY, because it explains the design. This repository used to be produced by a
# script in a separate private repository: it exported that tree, pruned the internal
# parts, and linted the result. Every check below lived in that script, so the rule was
# "a mistake is caught on its way out". Development now happens here directly, there is
# no copy-in, and that whole gate went with it. These are the checks that still make
# sense when the tree IS the deliverable, ported so they run on every push instead.
#
# Fails (exit 1) on: private key material, committed build artefacts, dangling relative
# links in Markdown, machine-specific absolute paths, personal-identity references, and
# --untracked on every scan, and it is load-bearing rather than tidy. `git grep` alone sees only
# TRACKED files, so a brand-new file is invisible to every check here until it is staged -- which
# means running this before `git add`, exactly as the instructions say to, returns a false green.
# That has already let a forbidden third-party name reach CI twice. --untracked still honours
# .gitignore, so build output and artifacts/ stay out of scope.
# a third-party project named outside the places we agreed it may be. Warns (exit 0) on
# the upstream-attribution mention, which is expected and must not block.
#
# Run from anywhere; it operates on the git-tracked tree.

# the *content* scans is what stops them flagging themselves. They stay inside the
# *filename* scans below, so a stray key or binary dropped in scripts/ is still caught.

# 4. Personal-identity references. The pattern is supplied from outside the repository
#    and is deliberately NOT written here: a literal in this file would publish the exact
#    string the check exists to find, which is the opposite of the point. CI passes it in
#    from a repository secret; set HEXIDE_IDENTITY_PATTERN (an extended-regex) locally to
#    run it by hand. Unset, the check announces that it did not run rather than passing
#    silently — a guard that quietly does nothing is worse than no guard, because it
#    still reads green.
#
#    Matched CASE-INSENSITIVELY, so write the pattern in plain lower case. Encoding case
#    by hand as [Mm][Aa]... is easy to get subtly wrong, and getting it wrong fails open:
#    an all-caps copyright header or a generated file would slip past a pattern that only
#    anticipated title case. Keep the pattern to the distinctive parts — a surname and an
#    employer, not a first name, which collides with unrelated third-party authors in
#    THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md and trains everyone to ignore the check.

# 6. Third-party naming. The rule: this repository never asserts anything about another
#    project's PLANS — no "X will be the backend", no "X's lane". Describing the
#    replaceable-backend seam generically is the default, because filling that blank in
#    is theirs to agree to, not ours to assume. A record MAY name a project where the
#    decision was genuinely about that project and has already happened. Three classes
#    are allowed, a file at a time:
#      * attribution — the Battleship demo derives from an MIT project and credits its
#        author; the LSP test README records why GPL-derived test inputs were not carried
#        over. Removing either would be a licence and honesty problem.
#      * licence provenance — vb6-grammar-fixes records which GPLv3 grammar is quarantined
#        and why; lsp-parity-matrix is the record of replacing the server built on it.
#        Naming the grammar is what makes the clean-room claim checkable.
#      * the routed wall — the interpreter README names twinBASIC to route users *to* it.
#        That is a deferral, not a comparison, and it needs the name to be actionable.
#    Anything else is a mention nobody decided on, so this fails closed and asks for a
#    decision. Adding a file here is a decision; a new mention inside a listed file still
#    deserves a read.
