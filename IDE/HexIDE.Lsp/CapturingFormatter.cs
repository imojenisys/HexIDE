/// <remarks>
/// <b>Wrapping rather than subclassing, and that is not a style preference.</b> Every serialization member
/// on the underlying formatter is <c>virtual final newslot</c> — the runtime's encoding of an ordinary
/// non-virtual interface implementation — so an <c>override</c> does not compile, and the <c>new</c> that
/// does compile is never called: a subclass built that way runs perfectly, captures zero frames, and gives
/// no indication of it. Measured on the pinned assembly.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Six interfaces, and forwarding all of them is a correctness requirement.</b> The one that costs most
/// to miss is <see cref="IJsonRpcInstanceContainer"/>: omit it and requests and responses keep working
/// while inbound <em>notifications</em> stop being delivered, with no exception, no log and a healthy
/// connection. That is <c>publishDiagnostics</c> vanishing — the same silent-blackout shape this client has
/// already been bitten by once. Any test here must assert a notification was <b>delivered</b>, never merely
/// that a call did not throw.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Both deserialize overloads, because HexIDE has three transports and they disagree.</b> Standard
/// input and named pipes call the two-argument overload exclusively; a web socket calls the one-argument
/// overload exclusively and does not require the text interface at all. Implementing one of them leaves the
/// tap blind on a transport rather than broken, which is the harder kind of gap to notice.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>One of these per connection.</b> The underlying formatter refuses to be associated with a second
/// <see cref="JsonRpc"/> instance, so a shared wrapper would fail on the first reconnect. The log behind it
/// is shared, which is what lets a connection's record survive its server being restarted.
