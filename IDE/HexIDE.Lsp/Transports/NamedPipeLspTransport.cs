        // automatically exit", and then outliving every client — leaving orphaned server processes on
        // each run. A transport that owns a child has to assume nothing else will reap it.

        // Unsubscribe first: the kill would otherwise raise Closed during teardown and invite the
        // client to reconnect to a transport that is being disposed.
