/// Phase 3 makes the code window show the whole file — designer block or module header included, folded and
/// read-only — so that one line number means the same thing to the editor, a language server, the
/// interpreter and the debugger. That only works if composing the two halves reproduces what was read. Every
/// later task (the buffer, the flush, dirty detection, the sidecar shift) assumes it, and none of them would
/// fail visibly if it were false: the file would simply come back subtly different.

/// <b>The LF fixtures are the point of this file, not a thoroughness flourish.</b> The code body used to be
/// rebuilt line by line with <c>StringBuilder.AppendLine</c>, which terminates with
/// <c>Environment.NewLine</c> — indistinguishable from the original on Windows and a silent rewrite of every
/// line to LF on Linux, where `build-ide` runs. The save path writes <c>Code</c> back verbatim while the
/// designer half is pinned to CRLF, so a form merely opened and saved on a Linux host came back with mixed
/// terminators. A test that only used CRLF fixtures would be green on this machine and green on CI for the
/// wrong reason; feeding LF input makes the defect reproducible on either.
