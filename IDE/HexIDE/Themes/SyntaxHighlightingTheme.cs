/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> <c>VB6.xshd.xml</c> hardcoded a light palette with no dark
/// counterpart, so on the Dark and Abyss packs the keyword colour <c>#0000B0</c> sat on editor
/// background <c>#252526</c> at roughly 1.1:1 — every keyword in the code window was invisible.</para>
///
/// <para><b>One definition, two palettes.</b> The xshd stays the single source of truth for the light
/// palette; its Foreground brushes are snapshotted at load. On a dark theme variant the named colours
/// are overwritten in place from <see cref="DarkPalette"/>, and switching back restores the snapshot.
/// Nothing is duplicated, so a new rule added to the xshd cannot silently drift — it simply keeps its
/// light colour until a dark entry is added here.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Keyed to the theme variant, not the pack.</b> Dark and Abyss both declare
/// <c>themeVariant: "Dark"</c>, so <c>ThemeService</c> leaves <c>RequestedThemeVariant</c> unchanged
/// when switching between them and no notification is raised. One dark palette that clears AA on both
/// packs' backgrounds therefore needs no per-pack hook. A bespoke per-pack scheme would require

///
/// <para><b>Mutation is global and does not repaint.</b> Every rule holds the same
/// <see cref="HighlightingColor"/> instance that <c>HighlightingManager</c> hands to every editor and
/// every minimap, so one write retints the whole IDE. But AvaloniaEdit bakes the brush into each
/// visual line's run properties when the line is built, so already-rendered text keeps the old colour
/// until <c>TextView.Redraw()</c> clears that cache. Views must do that from
