/// Answers "where is the workspace" for the language layer, from whichever project is currently the

/// <para>
/// Deliberately thin, and deliberately here rather than in the language layer. Reusing
/// <see cref="ProjectService.ProjectFilesDirectory"/> is the whole point: that is already the rule
/// deciding where a project's files live, including the fallback for a project that has never been saved,
/// and a second answer to the same question would drift from it.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>An unsaved project's directory is a shared temp path today</b> — keyed on the project's NAME, so
/// every new "Project1" resolves to the same place (hexide-io/HexIDE#260). That is wrong, and it is wrong
/// in the same way for a language server as it is for the files: the server is rooted somewhere that may
/// hold another project's leavings. Answering with it anyway is still better than answering with nothing,
/// because it is at least the directory the project's own files are in — and it stops being a special case
/// entirely once a new project gets a real location.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The project manager arrives as a factory, and it has to.</b> This type closes a dependency cycle —
/// <c>ProjectManager</c> needs an editor service, which builds code editors, which need the language
/// client, which needs this. Pure.DI cannot order a cycle, and it does not refuse one either: it emits the
/// singleton field <em>unguarded</em>, so whichever participant is constructed first receives
/// <see langword="null"/> for the back edge. Taking it as a factory defers the resolution past
/// construction, which is the same way <c>EditorService</c> holds its view-model factories.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// This was not a hypothetical. The direct dependency compiled, passed every test, and made
/// <c>Directory</c> throw a <see cref="NullReferenceException"/> on the first document opened — which
/// <c>CodeEditorViewModel.Initialize</c> logged and swallowed, so no language server ever started and the
/// IDE simply had no language features. Only running it found that.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// The manager is matched rather than dereferenced for the same reason. The factory defers the back edge
/// past construction, but the generated code still reads an unguarded field in some paths, so a null is
/// reachable in principle. This type already has a defined answer for "there is no workspace yet" —
/// <see langword="null"/> — and giving that answer costs a lazily started server nothing, where throwing
/// costs every language feature in the IDE.
