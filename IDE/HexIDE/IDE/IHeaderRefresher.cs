/// <para>
/// Since task 3.2 of hexide-io/HexIDE#273 the code window holds the whole file, not the code section: one
/// line number now means the same thing to the editor, a language server, the interpreter and the debugger.
/// The invariant that buys is <b>the buffer is the text of the file as it stands, and after a save it is the
/// text that save wrote</b> — which only holds if something moves the header when the thing it describes
/// moves. That is this.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Three triggers, one write path.</b> A committed designer change (<c>FormLayoutChangedEvent</c>), a
/// save (the header that was just written, before the save is announced), and a reload. All three land in
/// <see cref="ApplyHeader"/> or in <see cref="ShiftMarks"/>, so a document's marks cannot move for one
/// trigger and not for another.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It works with no window open, and that is the point of the seam rather than an accident.</b>
/// Breakpoints and bookmarks are bare integers held per document, not anchors in a buffer, so a header that
/// grows by a line moves every mark below it whether or not anybody is looking at the code. A refresher
/// that lived on the code editor would move the marks of the documents that happen to be open and silently
/// leave the rest pointing at the wrong statements.
