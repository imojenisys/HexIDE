/// <para>The error's only representation used to be a modal dialog, and <c>stop_project</c> and
/// <c>shutdown_ide</c> both close open dialogs — so the ordinary run → stop → look rhythm destroyed the
/// evidence before anything could read it. A run whose form silently did nothing was indistinguishable
/// from a run whose error dialog had been dismissed a moment earlier.</para>
///
/// <para>That is not hypothetical: a runtime error raised inside a <c>.bas</c> module was swallowed
/// entirely (the handler threw before it could show the dialog), and the automated symptom — a form that
/// runs and does nothing — looked exactly like success. It surfaced only because a human happened to see
/// something flash on screen.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Sequence, not just a message.</b> A caller needs to distinguish "no error this run" from "the
/// same error as last time", and comparing message text cannot do that — a loop can raise the identical
/// error twice. The counter only ever increases, so a caller that notes it before a run can tell exactly
/// whether that run added anything.</para>
