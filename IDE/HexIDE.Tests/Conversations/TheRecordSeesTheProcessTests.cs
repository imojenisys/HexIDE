/// <b>All three were found by comparing the capture against the tool it replaces, not by a failing test.</b>
/// The change's own spec carries a SHALL — "the record SHALL include its start, its termination, its exit
/// code, and everything it wrote to standard error" — and its task list ticked that as done while standard
/// error went only to a debug log and nothing in the tree read an exit code. Worse, the stdio transport's
/// <c>Unobservable</c> returns null, which is the record's way of promising a reader that nothing is
/// missing: the honesty mechanism was certifying absent data as present.
///
/// <para>
/// The third is the sharpest. A frame this client could not decode produced no entry at all, because the
/// recording ran after the deserialize that threw — so the record was blind in exactly the case somebody
/// opens the window for, while the window happily rendered a "not valid JSON" marker no wire path could
/// reach. Every malformed-body test in the tree injected through <c>Record</c> directly, which is how it
/// stayed hidden.
