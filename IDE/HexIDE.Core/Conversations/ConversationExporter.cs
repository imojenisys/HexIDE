/// <summary>
/// Writes a capture out as raw JSON-RPC, one message per line, plus a manifest.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Why this format and not a richer one.</b> It needs no decoder, it greps and it pipes, it survives a
/// message this client could not decode — which is exactly when an export matters — and it replays straight
/// into this project's own pipe-pair tests. The archived Microsoft LSP Inspector's envelope was considered
/// and rejected: the viewer no longer exists, and its published format and its reference implementation
/// disagree about the message-type strings, so adopting it would inherit an inconsistency that later reads
/// as a HexIDE defect. A SQLite schema whose own authors decline to stabilise it was rejected too.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Two files rather than one, because a message alone is not the finding.</b> Latency, size, direction
/// and outcome live in the envelope, and for a server author latency is the difference between a bug report
/// and an anecdote. Folding that metadata into each line would stop the lines being protocol messages,
/// which is the one property that makes this format worth choosing. So the manifest carries the envelope
/// table and each row names the <em>line number</em> its body is on — exact, and greppable with
/// <c>sed -n '42p'</c>.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Every envelope gets a line, including the ones with nothing to show.</b> A file that silently omitted
/// them would read exactly like a conversation that never contained them, which is the failure this design
/// refuses everywhere else. Those lines are valid JSON under a <c>hexide</c> key rather than a
/// <c>jsonrpc</c> one, so a replayer can tell them apart with a single field test and the counts in the
/// manifest say how many there were.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>And so does every answer, which is a line per FRAME rather than per envelope.</b> A response
/// completes its request instead of becoming an entry — that is right for a timeline read in order, and it
/// was wrong here: a file claiming to be the conversation, offered for replay, contained not one reply. So
/// an answer gets its own line and its own manifest row, marked <c>answerTo</c>, carrying the request's
/// method and id because on the wire a response has neither.
