# Demos

A gallery of small, self-running VB6 demoscene intros — each built end-to-end by driving the live
HexIDE IDE entirely through its MCP automation tools (the `demo-hexide-mcp` skill), then compiled
with the real VB6 compiler and verified by screenshot + resize.

Every **verified** demo is archived here in its own subfolder with its full VB6 source, a screenshot
and a README. They are meant to be kept — each is a working example of what MCP-driven HexIDE
automation can produce.

## Convention

Each demo lives in `demo/<jaunty-name>/` and contains:

- `<Name>.vbp` + `.frm`/`.cls`/`.bas` — the complete, self-contained VB6 source
- `screenshot.png` — the effect running
- `README.md` — what it is and how it works

The built `.exe` is **not** committed. `scripts/check-tree-hygiene.sh` rejects a build artefact in the
tree and CI enforces it, so a demo ships as source you rebuild rather than a binary you trust. This
README promised a committed binary until 2026-08-19; it never had one to promise, because the demo
executables stayed behind in the maintainers' repository when this one was split out.

Each demo gets a fresh, random, jaunty project name (never "Project1") so its build never collides
with another's. To rebuild any of them you need VB6 installed (`VB98\VB6.EXE`):
`VB6.EXE /make <Name>.vbp`.

## Gallery

| Demo | Effect |
|------|--------|
| [neon-aurora](neon-aurora/) | A six-part Amiga-style intro — raster plasma, copper bars, 3D starfield, glenz vector, vector balls and a sine-scroller, with real MIDI chiptune music |
| [wild-ecstasy](wild-ecstasy/) | Big wavy text — "HEXIDE" rippling on per-letter sine waves with colour cycling |
| [neon-vertigo](neon-vertigo/) | A rotating 3D sphere of 130 glowing vector balls — Fibonacci-distributed, spun on two axes, depth-shaded magenta→blue and painted back-to-front |
| [battleship](battleship/) | *(different kind)* An OO Battleship **engine** (classes, properties, object arrays, `WithEvents` events) whose full run is **byte-identical** on HexIDE's interpreter and real `vb6.exe` — a fidelity cross-check, not a graphical intro |
| [bill-of-fare](bill-of-fare/) | *(different kind)* A tour of the VB6 **menu** surface — bar, nested submenus, separators, shortcuts, access keys, a disabled item and click dispatch — hand-written to be looked at and clicked, and to give CI a menu form to round-trip |
| [spring-tide](spring-tide/) | *(different kind)* A short module with a deliberate syntax error, for opening with a **foreign language server** attached — its folding regions and diagnostics rendered in HexIDE's editor. Does not build, by design |

> **Note:** most demos above are graphical demoscene intros built by driving the live IDE through MCP. Two
> entries are different beasts. [battleship](battleship/) is a hand-written VBA program archived as an
> end-to-end **fidelity cross-check** (the same source runs identically on HexIDE's tree-walking interpreter
> and on the real VB6 compiler). [bill-of-fare](bill-of-fare/) is a hand-written tour of the **menu**
> surface, kept because every part of it once shipped broken under a green test suite, and each part was
> found by a person opening the menu and looking.
