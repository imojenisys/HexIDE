# serialization-round-trip Specification

## Purpose
Define what the IDE guarantees when it reads a project's files and writes them back.

This is the promise that decides whether the IDE can be pointed at work that matters. A developer opening a
real project is not evaluating a feature list — they are asking whether it is safe to press Ctrl+S. Real
projects are full of content the IDE has no model for: third-party component properties, add-in metadata,
binary resources, whole component types it has never heard of. If any of that is quietly dropped on save,
the damage is invisible at the moment it happens and discovered later, in the original product, on a file
that no longer opens.

The rule that follows from that is not "save everything correctly" — no reimplementation of a
twenty-year-old file format achieves that on the first pass. It is that the IDE must never write a file it
cannot reproduce. Preservation where it understands the content, and refusal where it does not.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Content the IDE does not understand SHALL survive a round-trip
Where a file contains content the IDE has no model for — a property, a property block, an entire component
type, a project key, or a trailing extension section — that content SHALL be preserved and written back.

This is the whole point. A file format this old is defined as much by what accumulated in it as by what was
specified: every add-in, every third-party control, every tool that ever touched the project left something
behind. An IDE that keeps only what it recognises is not reading a project, it is rewriting it as its own
subset — and the developer discovers which parts by finding out what stopped working.

#### Scenario: A property on a component the IDE does model
- **WHEN** a component carries a property the IDE does not recognise
- **THEN** the property is written back with the component

#### Scenario: An entire component type the IDE does not model
- **WHEN** a file contains a component of a type the IDE has no model for
- **THEN** the component is written back in place rather than dropped

#### Scenario: A section left by another tool
- **WHEN** a project file ends in a section belonging to some other tool
- **THEN** that section is written back

### Requirement: Preserved content SHALL be written back near where it was found
Content preserved verbatim SHALL be written back in a position corresponding to where it was read, as far as
the IDE's own additions and removals allow.

Position is not cosmetic in a format read by other tools: a key that has moved out of its section, or a
component that has moved out of its parent, is a key or component that has changed meaning. Approximating
the original position keeps the file recognisable to whatever wrote it, and keeps a diff readable — a save
that reshuffles a file is a save nobody can review.

#### Scenario: An unrecognised key among recognised ones
- **WHEN** an unrecognised project key sits between recognised keys
- **THEN** it is written back in approximately that position rather than collected at the end

### Requirement: A binary companion SHALL be named for the file it belongs to
Where a file's binary resources live in a companion file, that companion SHALL be named by the convention
belonging to that file's own type.

The convention differs per designer type, and the original product looks for the file the convention names —
nothing else. Writing every companion under one type's extension produces a file the original product does
not look for and one it cannot read, so the resources are lost even though they were written correctly.

#### Scenario: Saving a designer that is not a form
- **WHEN** a designer type with its own companion convention is saved with binary resources
- **THEN** the companion is written under that type's extension, not a form's

### Requirement: A save SHALL NOT be able to destroy the previous version
Writing a file SHALL be arranged so that the previous content survives intact until the new content is
complete. Where a designer file has a binary companion, the two SHALL be treated as one artifact: a save
SHALL write both halves or neither, and SHALL decide which before either is written.

Interrupted writes happen — a crash, a full disk, a killed process — and the file being written at that
moment is the one the developer cares about most. Writing in place means the interruption lands in the
middle of their source file; completing the write elsewhere first means the worst outcome is a leftover
temporary file next to an intact original.

A companion is not a separate file that happens to sit alongside. Each record's offset is simply where it
landed, and the designer file cites those offsets, so the citations are meaningful only against the exact
companion produced with them. Writing one half without the other leaves citations addressing a partition
that no longer exists — and because a file's faithfulness is re-derived from its own citations, the result
reopens as reproducible. The markers that would have flagged it are the ones that were overwritten.

Two halves cannot be committed to disk in one indivisible step, so the order SHALL be chosen for what an
interruption leaves behind. Writing the companion first leaves the previous designer file, whose citations
may overrun the new companion and be refused on the next load. Writing the text first leaves citations that
resolve inside the larger stale companion — to the wrong records, with nothing to indicate it. An
interrupted save SHALL fail towards the outcome the developer is told about.

#### Scenario: An interrupted save
- **WHEN** a save is interrupted before it completes
- **THEN** the file on disk is still the previous version, unmodified

#### Scenario: A file the IDE will not write
- **WHEN** a designer file cannot be written faithfully
- **THEN** neither it nor its companion is modified, and the developer is told which file and why

#### Scenario: An interrupted save of a designer file and its companion
- **WHEN** a save is interrupted between the two halves
- **THEN** what remains on disk is a pair whose mismatch is detected on the next load, rather than one that
  reads as correct

#### Scenario: A companion the designer file does not reference
- **WHEN** a save produces no binary content for a designer file that cited none
- **THEN** any companion beside it is left alone, because it holds content this file never referenced

#### Scenario: One record referenced by two properties
- **WHEN** more than one property cites the same companion content
- **THEN** it is written once, and both citations address the copy that was written

### Requirement: The IDE SHALL refuse to save a file it cannot reproduce
Where the IDE knows it would not reproduce a file faithfully, it SHALL leave the file on disk untouched and
SHALL tell the developer why, rather than writing a version it knows to be wrong. This SHALL hold wherever
that file would be written, **including a new location**.

Refusing is the honest response to an incomplete implementation, and it is what makes an incomplete one safe
to put in front of people. The alternative is a save that appears to succeed and produces a file the
original product cannot open — silent, discovered later, unrecoverable if it has been committed over the
original. A refusal is none of those things: nothing is lost, and the developer learns immediately what the
IDE cannot yet handle.

Saving to a new location is not a safe middle ground, and the IDE SHALL NOT treat it as one. The copy
carries the loss — content the IDE could not reproduce is absent from it — and because a file's
faithfulness is re-derived from the file itself, the copy then reads as reproducible. The very markers that
caused the refusal are what went missing, so nothing remains to raise it again: the copy opens without a
warning, edits freely, and saves over itself. A refusal the developer could have recovered from becomes a
file that looks correct and is not.

#### Scenario: Saving a file the IDE would not reproduce
- **WHEN** a save is requested for a file the IDE knows it cannot reproduce
- **THEN** the file on disk is unchanged and the developer is told which file and why

#### Scenario: Several such files in one save
- **WHEN** a save covers several such files
- **THEN** they are reported together rather than one prompt at a time

#### Scenario: A single file saved on its own
- **WHEN** one such file is saved outside a batch
- **THEN** the developer is told at that moment, and that refusal is not reported again during a later save

#### Scenario: Saving elsewhere
- **WHEN** the developer saves such a file to a new location
- **THEN** it is refused there too, and no destination is asked for, because the copy would carry the loss

### Requirement: A file the IDE will not save SHALL be presented as read-only
Where the IDE would refuse to save a file, its editing surfaces SHALL be read-only and SHALL state the
reason, while remaining open for viewing and running.

Discovering the refusal at save time means discovering it after the work is done. A developer who has spent
an hour on a form and is then told it cannot be written has lost the hour — and the refusal, which exists to
protect them, is what took it. Saying so up front turns the same limitation into something they can plan
around, and keeping the file viewable and runnable preserves the reason they opened the IDE at all.

#### Scenario: Opening such a file
- **WHEN** a file the IDE would refuse to save is opened
- **THEN** its editors are read-only and state why

#### Scenario: Running a project containing one
- **WHEN** a project containing such a file is run
- **THEN** it runs

### Requirement: Round-trip fidelity SHALL be measured against real projects
Fidelity SHALL be assessed by reading and rewriting real VB6 projects and comparing the result against the
originals, not by tests over content the IDE authored itself.

A test written against the IDE's own output only proves it is self-consistent. Everything this capability
exists to protect — the accumulated content, the conventions nobody wrote down, the things the original
product emits but never documents — is present only in files the original product actually produced. The
sample projects shipped with VB6 are the accessible corpus of exactly that, which makes them the measure.

#### Scenario: Assessing fidelity
- **WHEN** round-trip fidelity is assessed
- **THEN** it is measured over real VB6 projects, comparing rewritten files against the originals

### Requirement: Structure the IDE does model SHALL survive a round-trip
Where a file expresses a hierarchy among the things the IDE models, the IDE SHALL write that hierarchy
back as a hierarchy. Reading a nested structure and writing a flat one SHALL be treated as data loss, not
as formatting.

The existing requirements cover content the IDE does *not* understand, which it carries verbatim. This is
the opposite case and the more dangerous one: the IDE understood the components perfectly well and lost
the relationship between them. A menu tree written back flat is not a cosmetic difference — every item
becomes a top-level menu, which is a different program.

#### Scenario: A nested menu
- **WHEN** a form whose menus are nested is loaded and saved
- **THEN** the saved file expresses the same nesting

#### Scenario: Depth beyond one level
- **WHEN** a menu contains a submenu which itself contains items
- **THEN** every level is written back at its original depth

### Requirement: The refusal gate SHALL narrow as reproduction improves
Where the IDE becomes able to reproduce a structure it previously could not, the refusal gate SHALL stop
firing for that structure, and SHALL continue to fire for the structures still unreproducible.

A gate that stays shut after the reason for it is fixed is as wrong as one that never closed — it holds
files read-only for a defect that no longer exists, and it teaches developers that the read-only state is
arbitrary. Narrowing it in the same change that fixes the underlying defect is what keeps the gate
meaningful.

#### Scenario: A form whose only nesting is menus
- **WHEN** such a form is loaded, once menu nesting round-trips
- **THEN** it is editable and saveable

#### Scenario: A form with a populated container
- **WHEN** such a form is loaded, while container nesting does not round-trip
- **THEN** it is still presented read-only

### Requirement: A container's children SHALL be written back inside their container
Where a file expresses a control as a child of a container, the IDE SHALL write it back inside that
container rather than as a sibling of it.

The existing structure requirement was written for menus and is satisfied by them; this states the harder
half. It matters more than menu nesting because the original product does not defend against getting it
wrong: a file that nests a control under a class which cannot contain one is accepted without complaint and
the control is silently re-parented somewhere else. A flattened file therefore does not fail loudly in VB6 —
it opens, and the form is quietly a different form.

#### Scenario: A control inside a container
- **WHEN** a form with a control inside a container is loaded and saved
- **THEN** the saved file expresses that control inside the same container

#### Scenario: Containers within containers
- **WHEN** a container is itself a child of another container
- **THEN** every level is written back at its original depth

### Requirement: A child's position SHALL be interpreted relative to its container
Where a control is a child of a container, the IDE SHALL treat its stored position as measured from that
container's own origin, in every layer that reads or writes it.

The file measures a child from its container, and a container is free to move — the tab-switching idiom in
the original product's own templates parks a page off-screen and brings it back by assigning the container's
position. A layer that reads a child's stored position as a distance from the form therefore draws it in the
wrong place, and a layer that writes one back as such corrupts it. The two failures are the same mistake in
opposite directions, which is why no layer may hold the assumption privately.

#### Scenario: A child of a container parked off-screen
- **WHEN** a container is positioned outside the visible form and holds children
- **THEN** its children are drawn with it rather than at the equivalent distance from the form

#### Scenario: Moving a child in the designer
- **WHEN** the developer moves a control that is inside a container
- **THEN** what is written back is its position relative to that container

### Requirement: Unreproducible binary content SHALL hold a file read-only
Where a file cites binary content the IDE cannot reproduce — because the property carrying the citation is
one it does not model, or because the cited content did not reach the model at all — the IDE SHALL treat
that file as one it cannot reproduce.

The reference is what is lost, not the bytes: the companion file is left alone by a separate guard, so the
image survives on disk while the property pointing at it does not. That is a save which looks successful and
silently strips a control's picture, which is the same class of failure as flattening. Recognising it widens
the refusal before the container work narrows it — the count of refused files gets worse before it gets
better, and that is the correct direction, because a refusal is recoverable and a silent strip is not.

Whether the citation was honoured SHALL be judged against **what the file itself cites**, not against what
the companion yielded. A count taken from the companion cannot see a companion that is absent — there is
nothing to count — nor one that is truncated, where the unreachable offset is dropped from both sides at
once and they agree at a number lower than the file actually cites. The citations are in the file being
opened, so they can be counted whatever became of the file beside it.

#### Scenario: A property the IDE does not model referencing a companion blob
- **WHEN** such a file is loaded
- **THEN** it is presented read-only rather than saved with the reference dropped

#### Scenario: A modelled property referencing a companion blob
- **WHEN** the referencing property is one the IDE does model and the cited content reached the model
- **THEN** the file is not held read-only on that account

#### Scenario: A citation that cannot be honoured
- **WHEN** a file cites companion content that did not reach the model, because the companion is absent or
  too short to hold the cited offset
- **THEN** the file is presented read-only, however ordinary the property carrying the citation

#### Scenario: Two properties citing one offset
- **WHEN** more than one property cites the same companion offset
- **THEN** it counts once, so sharing content is not mistaken for a shortfall

### Requirement: A carried file SHALL round-trip without becoming source
The deserializer SHALL recognise the project-file key for a carried file, and SHALL place such an entry in a
collection separate from the compiled modules. A carried file SHALL NOT appear among the modules under any
circumstance.

This is a structural guarantee rather than a defensive one. Every operation that could damage a non-code
file — execution, extension-based rename on save, the module header writer — iterates the module collection.
Absence from that collection is what makes the damage unreachable; a guard at each site is something a later
change forgets to add.

Because the key is now recognised rather than falling through as an unknown line, it SHALL be counted on read
and re-emitted through the same counter on write. A key promoted from unknown to known that is not counted on
both sides shifts the position of every unknown line after it.

#### Scenario: A project carrying non-compiled files is re-saved untouched
- **WHEN** a project holding carried files is read and written back with no change
- **THEN** the output is byte-identical to the input, including any unknown lines that followed a carried entry

#### Scenario: A carried entry names no member name
- **WHEN** an entry uses the key that carries a path but no name field
- **THEN** the member's name is derived from the filename

### Requirement: A non-source file on a code line SHALL be reclassified, and its line preserved
Where an entry on a module or class line names a file that is not VB6 source, the deserializer SHALL treat it
as a carried file, and SHALL preserve that entry's original line to be re-emitted verbatim.

Both halves are required and they answer different risks. Reclassifying prevents the file being treated as
source and rewritten with a module header on the next save. Preserving the line prevents the opposite fault:
reclassification is an inference about intent, and silently editing a developer's project file on the
strength of an inference is a larger liberty than declining to. The line SHALL change only when the project's
membership actually changes.

A file with no extension SHALL NOT be reclassified on read. The project already claims it is source, and
reclassifying something that cannot be classified is a guess stacked on a guess.

#### Scenario: A document on a module line
- **WHEN** a module or class entry names a file that is not VB6 source
- **THEN** it becomes a carried file, and re-saving emits its original line unchanged

#### Scenario: Source on a module line
- **WHEN** a module or class entry names VB6 source, or a file with no extension
- **THEN** it remains a module

#### Scenario: A file the developer adds
- **WHEN** a carried file joins the project through the IDE rather than by being read
- **THEN** it is written using the project file's own key for a carried file

### Requirement: A path inside a project file SHALL be a Windows path on every host
Paths held in a project file SHALL be read and written as backslash-separated regardless of the host the IDE
is running on. The serializer SHALL emit backslashes for every member path; the deserializer SHALL preserve
the value verbatim, and SHALL derive a member's name from it using backslash and forward slash as separators.
Conversion to the host's separator SHALL happen only where a path is resolved against the filesystem, and
SHALL NOT affect what is written back.

A project file is a Windows-native format. The host path API answers about the *host* filesystem, so it is
the wrong tool for these strings: where a backslash is an ordinary filename character, deriving a name yields
the whole path and a carried file is named after its own directory, while relativising on write yields
forward slashes that go into a file which must contain backslashes. Both faults are silent — each produces a
value that still looks like a path — and neither is reachable on a Windows development machine.

Tests covering this SHALL express their expectations about project-file content as literal backslashed
strings, never by composing them with a host path API. An expectation built from the host follows whichever
machine runs it, and so certifies the defect on the platform where it matters rather than catching it.

#### Scenario: A member in a subdirectory is written
- **WHEN** a project holding a member in a subdirectory is saved
- **THEN** the emitted path uses backslashes, whatever host performed the save

#### Scenario: A member in a subdirectory is read back
- **WHEN** a project file naming a member in a subdirectory is read
- **THEN** the stored relative path is the backslashed value exactly as it appeared in the file

## Out of Scope
- **Interpreting preserved binary content.** Binary resources the IDE has no model for stay opaque; they are
  carried, never read.
- **Reproducing the original product's omissions.** The original product omits properties left at their
  default; the IDE writes what it holds. The result is semantically equal and slightly larger.
- **Preserving the original layout of content the IDE does model.** Recognised properties are written in the
  IDE's own order and spacing. Preserving the original arrangement would mean holding every file as raw text
  and giving up the model that makes the IDE an editor rather than a text editor.
